# Everthing about Flight Simulators
Here i will explain somethings (all of them) about the history and current flight simulators.
## History of Flight Simulators
The first version was from _Sublogic_, which later was aquired by **Microsoft**.
After that Microsoft continued with its development.
## First features
This is a picture from the first flight simulator.

In the first version, it has a single surface made with a grid, and another verticle plane with some contents.
I will show you some code:
```
	int a, b=0;
	return 0;
```
